# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Python 🐍

**Description:**

This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to predict heart disease based on a variety of health indicators. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities. The goal is to demonstrate a basic machine learning approach to heart disease prediction. 🩺

**Features:**

* **Data Loading:** Loads heart disease data from a CSV file. 📂

* **Data Exploration:** Displays the first and last few rows, shape, information, statistical description, and target variable distribution of the dataset. 🔍

* **Data Preprocessing:** Splits the data into features (X) and target (Y). 🧹

* **Train-Test Split:** Divides the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation. ➗

* **Model Training:** Trains a Logistic Regression model using the training data. 🤖

* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance on both training and testing data using accuracy scores. 📈

* **Prediction System:** Creates a simple predictive system that takes input data and predicts the likelihood of heart disease. 🔮

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 🐍

* Pandas 🐼

* NumPy 🔢

* Scikit-learn 🔬

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone ,<repo url>`

2. Ensure you have the `heart.csv` dataset in the same directory as your script.

3. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`

4. Run the Python script.

**Example Usage:**

The script will load the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and then make a prediction based on sample input data.  It will print the accuracy on the training and test data, as well as the prediction result (healthy or heart disease).
